## Credits

### Code Used
Python was fun and I would like to continue creating other projects. But, I did have much help from the people of YouTube.

- Learn Learn Scratch Tutorials helped with the creation of the typewriter effect block of code.

- Bro Code was a awesome source to go over Python.

### Content

The Library Adventure story was thought of by Amanda Pita, but the inspiration for the story came from reading countless fantasy stories. It sometimes helps to be a librarian. 

### Acknowledgments
Again, I would like to give thanks to my husband. Who I kept on asking to check if the quiz worked on his phone even though I could have checked it on my phone. But, two sets of eyes are better then one. 

As always, I'm extremely grateful to my mentor Martina who encourages me, especially when I was ready to call it quits. The best mentor anyone can ask for!
