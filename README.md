## Design

### Colour Scheme
I used the Colorama module as a way to colour my text in the Python terminal. The Library Adenture title has stayed white because I wanted the title to pop especially with the black background. The book ASCII art is red due to the story mentioning a red book. "Please enter your name:" is yellow as well as when the user puts in their name or not. When the user inputs the wrong answer, the prompt is red. When the user is asked if they want to play again, the "Play Again?" is in green. 

### Imagery 
With talking about libraries and books, of course, I wanted to add an image of book. The ASCII book art is was a great choice, because of one book on it's side. It is like that one is the one that catches the players eyes.

## Features

### Flow Chart
I used [Lucid Chart](https://lucid.app/) to create my story flow for the text-based adventure game.

### Future Implementations

- Add another adventure to the story. At the end of Library Adventure, there is an option to go on another adventure, but I added that it was still in the middle of brewing. 
- I would also like to experiment with adding different characters to the story.

## Testing

### Testing Validation 
I used the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) for test validation.

### Unfixed Bugs
I took the Library Adventure title and book art from ASCII. Both the title and art made it within the 80 col rule, but there were trailing white spaces that I was not able to get rid off. When I tried it moved the symbols in a different directions. Puting it through the CI Python Linter, it does show the trailing whitespaces for that area.

## Credits

### Code Used
Python was fun and I would like to continue creating other projects. But, I did have much help from the people of YouTube.

[Learn Learn Scratch Tutorials YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h8e0tXHfk0&t=134s)

- Learn Learn Scratch Tutorials helped with the creation of the typewriter effect block of code.

- Bro Code was a awesome source to go over Python.

- Tech with Tim gave me the inspiration for a text-based adventure game.

- Tech with Tim helped with adding colour to the text with using Colorama.

### Content

The Library Adventure story was thought of by Amanda Pita, but the inspiration for the story came from reading countless fantasy stories. It sometimes helps to be a librarian. 

### Acknowledgments
Again, I would like to give thanks to my husband. Who continues to encourage me to keep going forward. 

As always, I'm extremely grateful to my mentor Martina who encourages me. The best mentor anyone can ask for!
